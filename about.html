<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Vimeet Sood. I was born in Delhi, There I spent 12 years of my initial life. Then due to some circumstances, I had to shift to Ludhiana, Punjab. I still miss my Birthplace a lot. I still consider myself as more of a Delhite than a Ludhianvi. My parents were born and brought up in Delhi as well. Most of my family lives in Delhi. I have my massi which lives in Ludhiana, as a matter of fact, she lives in the next street. So yeah, it aint that bad. These days you can find me in my University Chitkara University.   </p>

<p>I had to change my schools every now and then since the start. This helpmed me make as many friends as I could. My best friends are Nikhil and Jasmine and my girlfriend is Ananaya. I love my people very much. </p>

<p>I'm a theatre artist. A green belt in Taekwondo. I can sing well. I have a creative mind. I can do many things if I really have my heart in it. I now have to do ANYTHING to get a job as soon as possible</p>
